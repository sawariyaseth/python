this project is going to implement ai api to a game. 

You can run the /temp_run.py/ file, which already calls the /ai_decision function/ and prints the result. Here's the relevant code:

You can run this script in the terminal usin


import json
from ai_service import ai_decision

history = [29,22,19,34,32,9,3,23,28,16,9,20,35,10,17,10,17,10,36,2,19,20,24,2,19,1,7,21,3,23,19,30,8,2,5,5,5,28,33,7,21,12,24,3]
result = ai_decision(history, 0.01)
print(json.dumps(result))

You can run this script in the terminal using the following command:

& C:\Users\Dell\python\.venv\Scripts\python.exe "c:/Users/Dell/python/ai python/temp_run.py"

JavaScript Example
If you want to run the JavaScript files, you can use roulette.js or roulette_integrated.js. For example, roulette_integrated.js has a test section that logs results to the terminal. You can run it using Node.js:

node "c:/Users/Dell/python/ai python/roulette_integrated.js"
